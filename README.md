## Introduction
The main goal of this third assignment is to gather web based data from at least two sources, merge the data sets, conduct basic descriptive and some inferential statistics on the data to address a relevant research question and briefly describe the results including with dynamically generated tables and figures.

## Hypothesis and Methodology
Our hypothesis is the follow there is a direct correlation between Internet accessibility and student's academic ability and economic growth.

To prove this hypothesis we plot these variables of all countries that we have data, which have different internet accessibility rate, student's academic ability and economic growth. Then, we have analyzed the correlation between these variables.

### Education and Internet Accessibility
The result shows the strong correlation between internet accesibility and average schoolong year and quality of education system, and this is statistically significant.

### GDP and Internet Accessibility
The result shows a strong correlation between internet accesibility and GDP per capita, and this is statistically significant.

## Conclusion
The results obtained in the three different figures have been similar. We can observe that all the data introduced in every different figure, that is all the points, draw a clear upward curve tendency, and correlatons are statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude our hypothesis is true.

However, the drowned upward curve is not exactly the same in all three cases. The upward curve between Internet Accessibility and Quality of Education is far more dispersed than GDP per capita and Internet users. The latter is much more uniform with just a few points clearly away from the main tendency of the curve. Likewise, in the second figure it can be appreciated that the uniformity of the upward curve it is between the first and the third figure.
